## 📗 DESCRIPTION

This is a resource pack for the Bare Bones texture pack that lowers the height of fire animations when you're standing on fire or burning. It keeps the minimalist aesthetic intact while improving visibility during gameplay. It's perfect for players who want a clean, unobtrusive look without the overwhelming flames.
